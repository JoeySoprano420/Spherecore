Here are the file extensions for Spherecore, categorized by their function in the compilation pipeline:

⸻

Spherecore File Extensions:
	1.	Source Code Files:
	•	.sphe: Spherecore source code file
Example: main.sphe
	•	Contains Spherecore syntax (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.).
	•	This is the primary file type where users write their Spherecore programs.
	2.	Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Files:
	•	.sphe-ast: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) dump in hexadecimal format
Example: main.sphe-ast
	•	Stores the parsed, structured version of the Spherecore source code in hex-based AST format.
	3.	Intermediate Representation (IR) Files:
	•	.sphe-bin: Binary intermediate representation file
Example: main.sphe-bin
	•	Spherecore’s intermediary code, optimized and used for further compilation into machine code.
	4.	Executable Files:
	•	.exe: Compiled Windows executable
Example: main.exe
	•	The final output of AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, ready to be executed on Windows.
	5.	Assembly Files (Optional, for Low-Level Debugging):
	•	.sphe-asm: Assembly output of Spherecore source code
Example: main.sphe-asm
	•	Contains human-readable assembly instructions after compilation, useful for low-level debugging.
	6.	Debug Files:
	•	.sphe-dbg: Debug information
Example: main.sphe-dbg
	•	Stores metadata for breakpoints, memory mappings, and real-time execution tracing.
	7.	Configuration Files:
	•	.sphe-config: Configuration file for compiler settings
Example: project.sphe-config
	•	Stores project-specific settings like optimization flags, target architecture, etc.

These file extensions cover all stages of the Spherecore pipeline, from writing source code to producing optimized executables and debug information.
