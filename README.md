2. Spherecore Compiler Structure

The Spherecore Compiler is designed to execute real programs efficiently while supporting real-time debugging. It integrates AOT compilation and JIT execution with low-level optimizations for AVX2 SIMD targeting Ryzen 3 processors.

Phases:
	1.	Lexical Analysis (Lexer)
	â€¢	Tokenizes input source code into structured components (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators).
	â€¢	Inline assembly support with x86-64 assembly for fast execution.
	2.	Syntax & Semantic Analysis (Parser)
	â€¢	Verifies the correctness of the structure and meaning of code.
	â€¢	Checks for undefined variables, type mismatches, and invalid syntax.
	3.	Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation
	â€¢	Generates a hexadecimal AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
	â€¢	Binary intermediary code optimized for SIMD execution and x86-64 compatibility.
	4.	Code Optimization
	â€¢	Performs low-level optimizations for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and register allocation.
	â€¢	Optimized memory access using SIMD for AVX2 to speed up math-heavy tasks.
	5.	Assembly Generation
	â€¢	Translates optimized IR to final assembly (x86-64).
	â€¢	Generates .exe binaries directly compatible with Windows.

3. Compiler Diagnostics & Real-Time Debugging

Real-time debugging features integrated into the Spherecore compiler include:
	1.	Advanced Error Reporting
	â€¢	Syntax Errors: Detected during lexical analysis
	â€¢	Semantic Errors: Identifies undefined variables, incorrect type usage, etc.
	â€¢	Runtime Errors: Detects memory leaks, invalid pointer dereferencing.
	2.	Warning System
	â€¢	Provides optimization hints such as suggesting SIMD usage for better performance.
	â€¢	Detects redundant code patterns or unused variables.
	3.	Performance Profiling
	â€¢	Measures execution time for functions.
	â€¢	Provides real-time statistics like CPU and GPU times for specific functions.
	â€¢	Enables users to benchmark performance across different functions.
	4.	Breakpoint Injection
	â€¢	Uses int3 assembly instruction to inject breakpoints in code.
	â€¢	Allows for real-time pausing of execution at any instruction.
	5.	Execution Tracing
	â€¢	Logs the execution of every CPU instruction in real-time.
	â€¢	Shows each instruction with operand values and results during execution.
	6.	Memory Leak Detection
	â€¢	Integrates AddressSanitizer for detecting and reporting memory issues like use-after-free errors, buffer overflows, and memory leaks.
	7.	Call Stack Tracing
	â€¢	Tracks and displays the call stack during execution.
	â€¢	Provides detailed function call information, making it easy to inspect the flow of a program.

4. Execution Engine Enhancements

Execution engine optimizations ensure maximum speed while retaining the ability to compile with AOT (Ahead-Of-Time).
	1.	SIMD Optimization (AVX2)
	â€¢	Makes use of AVX2 SIMD instructions to speed up computations, especially for vectorized math operations.
	â€¢	Optimizes loops, matrix multiplication, and other compute-intensive tasks using SIMD registers.
	2.	JIT Execution Optimizations
	â€¢	When needed, the compiler can compile code just-in-time to the processor for dynamic optimizations.
	â€¢	Supports in-place memory updates and runtime compilation, while avoiding performance penalties typically associated with JIT.
	3.	Memory Management
	â€¢	Handles stack and heap memory manually with low-level control.
	â€¢	Registers are optimized for local variables, and the heap is managed using custom allocators to minimize fragmentation.

5. Real-Time Debugger Integration

The real-time debugger allows developers to step through code, inspect memory, and troubleshoot errors.
	1.	Debugger Tools
	â€¢	Step-through execution for live debugging.
	â€¢	Variable inspection: Check and modify variable states at any point in execution.
	â€¢	Dynamic memory allocation tracking: Monitor memory usage and detect leaks or misuse.
	2.	Debugger Hooks
	â€¢	Custom breakpoints in any instruction or function.
	â€¢	Trace function calls, view call stacks, and track register values.
	3.	Breakpoint Injection in Assembly
	â€¢	Provides an int3 breakpoint in x86-64 assembly, allowing developers to pause and inspect the program at any instruction.

6. Final Output: Executable Generation

The Spherecore compiler compiles source code into a native .exe file, ready for execution on Windows (x64 architecture).
	1.	AOT Compilation
	â€¢	The code is first compiled ahead of time into an optimized binary format, ready for direct execution.
	2.	Executable File Creation
	â€¢	Once compiled, the final output is a standalone executable (.exe) file, directly runnable without the need for external dependencies or runtime environments.
